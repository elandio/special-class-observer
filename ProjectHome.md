The App should support lecturers to find out whether a student has problems with different subjects in class, for example problems in reading, calculation, writing, painting, being concentrated or just paying attention. Problems of students in different subjects could be an indication, that this student has special needs. Based on the collected data the app should provide proposals if a psychologist should be contacted.
The app provides a list of the students in class. The lecturer can click on a student to open his/her profile. He/she can see the existing entries of the student can edit them or add missing notes. To provide more detailed information, the user can select the hardness grade for some entries. The user interface should be very intuitive and easy to use, so that the lecturer is not distracted from his lecture or lesson.
The user should be able to export a student’s profile in a PDF-file to print or share it. It should also be possible to send the student’s profile to a psychologist, which can provide further support.
